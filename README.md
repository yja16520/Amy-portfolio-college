# College Portfolio — Static Site

A clean, fast, accessible portfolio website for a college application demo. Built with plain HTML/CSS/JS — deploy anywhere.

## Quick start
1. Edit **index.html**: replace the default text (name, email, sections).
2. Put your images in **assets/img** (keep file names or update the `src` paths).
3. Replace **assets/docs/resume.pdf** with your résumé.
4. Open **index.html** to preview locally. Deploy via GitHub Pages or Netlify.

## Deploy — GitHub Pages
- Create a new repo, commit these files, push to `main`.
- In GitHub: **Settings → Pages → Deploy from Branch → main / root**.
- Your site will be live at `https://&lt;username&gt;.github.io/&lt;repo&gt;/`.

## Deploy — Netlify (drag & drop)
- Go to Netlify, **Add new site → Deploy manually**, drag the project folder.
- Forms work out-of-the-box with `netlify` attribute on `<form>`.

## Accessibility & SEO
- Semantic HTML, keyboard-friendly nav, lazy images, meta/OG tags.
- JSON‑LD Person schema included.
- Responsive layout, dark/light auto via `prefers-color-scheme`.

## Customize
- Colors & spacing: edit CSS variables at the top of **styles.css**.
- Sections: duplicate a `<section>` block in **index.html** if needed.
- Gallery: drop more images into **assets/img** and add `<img>` tags.
